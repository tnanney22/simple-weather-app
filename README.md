Simple Weather
My project aims to utilize free weather API's to make a simple weekly forecast for any city in the United States. Additionally, it will be able to provide answers to simple questions like: "What is the hottest day of the week?" or "When does the sunrise today?"
As an outdoor enthusiast, I want to create an interactive weather app that answers simple users questions so that visitors can plan their week outdoors.
